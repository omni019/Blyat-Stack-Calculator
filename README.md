# Blyat Stack Calculator

Blyat Stack Calculator is a simple yet powerful tool to convert Minecraft items into stacks and shulkers.  
Some antivirus programs may **falsely flag** the app as a virus (they're just scared of how powerful it is).  
To avoid this, you can compile it yourself with the included installer.
